                        <p>Moldova - officially the Republic of Moldova (Romanian: Republica Moldova), is a landlocked
                            country in
                            Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and
                            south. The capital city is Chișinău.</p>
                        <p class="desktop_hidden">
                            Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th
                            century until 1812, when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire (to which
                            Moldavia was a vassal state) and became known as Bessarabia. In 1856, southern Bessarabia
                            was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania, but
                            Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 Russian
                            Revolution, Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic, known
                            as the Moldavian Democratic Republic. In February 1918, the Moldavian Democratic Republic
                            declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of
                            its assembly. The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia, which in 1924 established, within
                            the Ukrainian SSR, a Moldavian autonomous republic (MASSR) on partially Moldovan-inhabited
                            territories to the east of Bessarabia. In 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop
                            Pact, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, leading to the creation
                            of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part
                            of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR (east of the Dniester River). <a

                        <hr>
                        <p>Moldova is divided into 32 districts (raioane, singular raion), three municipalities and two
                            autonomous regions (Gagauzia and Transnistria). The final status of Transnistria is
                            disputed,
                            as the central government does not control that territory. 10 other cities, including Comrat
                            and
                            Tiraspol, the administrative seats of the two autonomous territories, also have municipality
                            status.

                            Moldova has 66 cities (towns), including 13 with municipality status, and 916 communes.
                            Another 700
                            villages are too small to have a separate administration and are administratively part of
                            either
                            cities (41 of them) or communes (659). This makes for a total of 1,682 localities in
                            Moldova, two of
                            which are uninhabited.

                        <hr>
                        <p>Moldova has a climate which is moderately continental; its proximity to the Black Sea leads
                            to the climate being mildly cold in the autumn and winter and relatively cool in the spring
                            and summer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova" target="_blank">More about

                            The summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about 20 °C (68 °F) and the
                            winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging −4 °C (25 °F).
                            Annual rainfall, which ranges from around 600 mm (24 in) in the north to 400 mm (16 in) in
                            the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs
                            in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of
                            the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.

                            The highest temperature ever recorded in Moldova was 41.5 °C (106.7 °F) on 21 July 2007 in
                            Camenca. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −35.5 °C (−31.9 °F) on 20 January
                            1963 in Brătușeni, Edineț county.

                        <p>Moldova's rich soil and temperate continental climate (with warm summers and mild winters)
                            have made the country one of the most productive agricultural regions since ancient times,
                            and a major supplier of agricultural products in southeastern Europe. In agriculture, the
                            economic reform started with the land cadastre reform.[135] Moldova's agricultural products
                            include vegetables, fruits, grapes, wine, and grains.</p>
                        <p class="desktop_hidden">
                            Moldova's proximity to the Black Sea gives it a mild and sunny climate. The fertile soil
                            supports wheat, corn, barley, tobacco, sugar beet, and soybeans. Beef and dairy cattle are
                            raised, and beekeeping is widespread. Moldova's best-known product comes from its extensive
                            and well-developed vineyards concentrated in the central and southern regions. In addition
                            to world-class wine, Moldova produces liqueurs and sparkling wine. It is also known for its
                            sunflower seeds, walnuts, apples, and other fruits. This makes the area ideal for
                            agriculture and food processing, which accounts for about 40% of the country's GDP.

                            Other successes include the privatization of nearly all of Moldova's agricultural land from
                            state to private ownership, as a result of an American assistance program, "Pamînt"
                            ("land"), completed in 2000. A stock market opened in June 1995.
